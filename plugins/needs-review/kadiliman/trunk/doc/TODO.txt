KNOWN BUGS:
-----------
About the plugin there is one little issue, 
the sub check for dupes is disable, 
so the file keeps a lots of duplicate lines... 
as I didn't analyze the pm file, 
I don't know if it uses the duplicate lines to calculate
the rate of sentences to answer or if it doesn't matter...
