Scroll
Makes the chat scroll in either direction. Speed and amount of characters to move can be adjusted with scspeed, scchars. The title can be set with sctitle. You can add titles with sctitle and clear them with sctitlesclear.

Swap
When in swap the chat will swap between different topics, a little less bot like if you set it to a high interval. However might not be very usefull. Adjust the swap speed with scspeed. 

IMPORTANT!
You must no longer create the chat yourself however you must leave it after you are done. Type 'chat leave' in console.

Code:

	title_1 "Iron Ore (150z), Coal (1k), Steel (3k), Ori (10k), "
	title_2 "Star Crumb (2k), Star Dust (200z), Elements (10k), "
	mode 0 #Mode 0 = scroll
	speed 1
	prefix "B> "
	direction left
	chars 2
}

scrollingChat Sell Weapons {
	title_1 "S> +8 Fire Swordmace"
	title_2 "S> +5 Wind Claymore"
	title_3 "S> +5 Earth Claymore"
	mode 1 #Mode 1 = Swap
	speed 10
}

scrollingChat Smile! {
	title_1 "Smiiiile ! ~~~~ "
}


Note.
If you use mode 0 (scroll) the strings you enter will be put together. so if you have 'title_1' , 'title_2' the chat title will be 'title_1 + title_2'.
