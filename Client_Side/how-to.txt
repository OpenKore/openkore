*** This patch is just a proof of concept. It probably won't work for you! ***






1. You need to modify a system dll which will be used by ragexe (eg. d2d1 or audioses) in System32 (or SysWoW64 if your system is 64bit)
2. Using tools like cff explorer or stud_pe, add import function FuckEAC from hooktest.dll, then put my 2 dlls into your Ragnarok folder.
3. I bypassed that dumb "OpenCore" check in my dll, they can't even spell it right, how can they block it? LOL.
4. Revert all previous hmac changes, we are now using EAC against itself in XKore 1 mode.
5. Start game and it should work, if it breaks, you can fix it yourself or be patient and wait.



Some researches on the new EAC,
they are using a changed MD5 algorithm now, for example, they changed one byte in MD5 IVs
from 01234567 89ABCDEF FEDCBA98 76543210 (standard) to 01234567 89BACDEF FEDCBA98 76543210
and MD5Transform is changed too, I don't list all the variables here.

Also the sequence seems to be starting from a random value instead of 0, hmac key is from that extra 0x80 bytes from 0A7B packet.
If I have time I will try to reverse engineer it, but right now I just take a shortcut with its own code.

Update:

I've improved and bypassed their new attemps to block/detect it.
