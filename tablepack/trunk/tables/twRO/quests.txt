Would you go and deliver this letter to Kaci for me? It's from some guy named Mr. Mawong, her mentor or something like that.#
Deliver the letter to Kaci.#

8037#Delivering letter to Kaci#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Oh, Hallen must have asked you to deliver this. He should be doing this sort of thing himself, instead of asking customers for favors! If you ever need a little favor from me, feel free to ask me, alright?#
 #

8039#Secret of Airships#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
These Airships are so huge and heavy, and I can scarcely believe that they can fly. How is it even possible? you could find out for me, Well, if it'd be a really big help.#
 #

8040#Secret of Airships#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Really...? Are you serious? An imitation of Ymir's Heart Piece. Now where have I heard about that before? Mm, let me think... #
 #

8041#Secret of Airships#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Kaci told me about a drunkard that always mentions Ymir's Heart when he plays the Dice game for Apples!#
 #

8042#Secret of Airships#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
I met that guy when I was helping Shinokas. He was one of the directors of the Einbroch Laboratory that had a piece of Ymir's Heart. It's worth investigating...#
 #

8043#Secret of Airships#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
You were asking me about the Airship's flight mechanics. So you're not an employee... You better get out of here. The guards patrol this place regularly, so you're almost sure to get caught. Hmm, come and see me later at the Airship, alright? Now hurry!#
You must go and see Ferlock.#

...Are you really willing to go out and look for Thierry for me? Oh, thank you so much! You don't know how much your kind offer means to me. Thierry went on a trip, traveling on one of the Airships, to find some medicine that the doctors say I need for my illness.#
 #

8045#Tips from Kaci#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Ah, I know! I'll ask the Airship Captain to help you: he's got the list of passengers and their destinations.#
Check out the passengers list from the captain.#

8046#Ferlock's Passengers list#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
According to this, he last took an Airship to Hugel. That's all that this says.#
 #

8047#Euslan's Favor#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
If you get the chance, please visit my brother Eukran in Hugel, and ask him where my Thierry might be.#
 #

8048#Eukran's Testimony#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
You see, Thierry passed by here about a month ago, and told me that he had to visit the Odin Shrine. I wasn't sure then, but now I think he's trying to help my sister.#
 #

8049#Thierry's Favor#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
I can't really go into the details, but I'm doing this work to find a cure for Euslan's disease. It's not curable by modern medicine...#
 #

8050#Danger coming on to Thierry#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Thierry seems to have caught on to what we're really up to. I think that's why he's slowing down on his research. We better get rid of him before it's too late.#
 #

8051#Euslan's Medicine#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
It doesn't matter what happens to me, but I must save Euslan. I only need 5 Runes of the Darkness to finish that medicine. Please help me get them, adventurer...#

8052#Thierry's Favor#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Please understand that I want to see her as soon as I can, but I have to wait until those Rekenber agents stop searching for me. Please give that medicine to Euslan as soon as you can: her life depends on it.#

This tree means so much to everyone in this town, and we all have special memories of this place. But that El Schatt fellow plans to chop it down for his shop...#
 #

8058#Conversation with El Schatt#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Look, memories are nice and all, but I don't dwell on the past. Hey, I've got some great memories of this place too, but you know what? I've decided to let go of them before they get too painful. That's life. My father's been wanting to build a shop here for so long, and now, I think it's about time.#
 #

8059#Conversation with Perfitz#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
I'm pleased that my son has finally set his mind on the family business. It's funny... He used to deperately fight me when it came to building shops where that tree has planted. I get this gut feeling that something's not right, like he's too excited about cutting that tree down. Maybe this old man is just too suspcious~#
 #

8060#Stubborn El Schatt#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
It's true that I used to think differently... I'd protect that old tree with my life, I won't deny it. But that's an old story that should be buried in the past..#

Now El Schatt is just a heartless, money grubbing...! He's completely changed. My sister would be rolling in her grave, seeing him now...#

11061#Coward Mikhail#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
He looked pale and asked me a high-strength adhesive. He might have broken something important. I told him to go look in the bar where bunch of guys usually are at.#
Looks like Mikhail went to the bar. Go to the bar and find him.#

11062#Coward Mikhail#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
I don't know much about adhesives so I introduced Mikhail an expert, that guy over there named Victor.#
Lookslike Mikhail is no longer at the bar.  Ask Victor about Mikhail's whereabouts.#

11063#Coward Mikhail#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Here you are. This is what you ordered. Have fun!#
Approach Victor while drinking.#

11064#Coward Mikhail#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
To get the stuff for a high-strength adhesive, we should go to  an isloated swamp. I don't believe that the little and timid boy like Mikhail goes there.#
Where would he be? Maybe you should go to the swamp just in case.#

11065#Coward Mikhail#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
You feel sticky just when you see a swamp.  Gas bubbles are rising. The atmosphere  here is pretty fearful.#
I don't see any traces. Firest, I'm going back to Mikhail's.#

11066#Coward Mikhail#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
You searched the house again and found Mikhail hiding inside the fire pot. Let's get the adhesive to help Mikhail fix Matroshuca.#
Go back to Victor to ask what materials are needed to make the adhesive exactly.#  

11067#Coward Mikhail#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
There's a large island near Moscovia. If you go deep into its forest, you can find a swamp where sticky weeds are growing. You should bring^3131FF'10 sticky herbs'^000000 and ^3131FF 1 medicine bowl^000000 to me.#
Bring 10 sticky hervs and 1 medicine bowl to Victor!#

11068#Coward Mikhail#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Ok, done! I don't want you to bother me any longer! Please go with that stuff!#
You've got the adhesive.  Go back to Mikhail.#

11069#Coward Mikhail#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Now I'm going to give this Matroshuca back to Mom.#
Mikhail finally came out of the fire pot. Return to Gallina.#

11070#Poison King#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Why do you want to learn about it? Even if I wanted to teach, I'm too old to remember everything. Go find my last disciple, ^0000FF'Song Zhi Du'^000000, as he may tell you something useful.#
Find Song Zhi Du working at the doctor's office and ask about the use of poison.#

11071#Poison King#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Go do whatever you were going to do. I'm just disappointed...#
Song Zhi Du seems to be mad now. Can make him feel better by bringing something to him.#

11072#Poison King#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
If you really feel sorry for me, then you must help me carry out my revenge! Go and get me, ^0000FF4 Bee Sting, 10 Venom Canine, 10 Empty Potion, 30 Green Potion^000000.#
Return to Song Zhi Du with materials he asked for.#

11073#Poison King#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
All that's left is to create this poison, and then to get the lord of Louyang to drink it...#
Talk to him again and listen to the story, then do the favor of Song Zhi Du.#

11074#Poison King#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Now that the fee is paid, please bring this to Song Zhi Du.#
You've obtained the material. Go back to Song Zhi Du.#

11075#Poison King#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
No!! I failed again! And I spent a long time preparing all of those materials...#
More materials are needed.#

11076#Poison King#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Please sneak into the Castle of the Dragon. I want you to put this poison some place where Lord Bai Long might stay. Anyway, I'm sure my master will be happy to know that I finally created the ^0000FFpoison he wished to create^000000!#
What should I do?#

11077#Poison King#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
You found a drink bottle that's possibly owned by Bai Long, lord of Louyang. You put the deadly poison into the bottle.#
You've done what Song Zhi Du asked for. Let's go back.#

11078#Poison King#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
You tell Nagash Arses how Song Zhi Du created this Deadly Poison Bottle and his plan to get his revenge on the lord of Louyang.#
Looks like he needs some time alone.#

11079#Poison King#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
I beg of you. Please do not let him bring any harm to the lord. I am pretty sure he's been asking you, as well as others, for aid... Please interrupt him from carrying out his plan.#
Get rid of the drink bottle of Bai Long.#

11080#Poison King#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
You take the drink bottle and replace it with a bottle filled with Sticky Mucus. Hopefully Bai Long won't notice!#
Replacement Successful! Go back to Nagash Arses.#

11081#Poison King#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
This is a journal that I have been writing for 15 years about my feelings of guilt, and what really happened in the past. I hope you can deliver this to the lord for me.#
Deliver Nagash Arses' Jounal to the lord.#

11082#Poison King#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Please, take this as a token of gratitute. And please deliver this letter to Nagash and Song Zhi Du for me.#
Journal delievered. Deliver the letter to Nagash.#
