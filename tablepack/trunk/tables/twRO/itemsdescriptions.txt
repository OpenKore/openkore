The ^ff0000Statue of Kunlun's Greatest Philosopher^000000, stands proudly in the middle of town, ready to
inspire great thoughts from all those that gaze upon him.  All around Kunlun are spectacular ^ff0000Overlooks of the World^000000.  
But there are particular spots that are exceptionally breathtaking, please watch your step.
There is a ^ff0000small hill in Kunlun^000000 that is said to of been the Great Philosophers favorite meditation spot, 
you should visit there and see if any grand thoughts take you.  
No matter how great a culture is, there will always be a few among its citizenry that just don't 'get it'. 
Those in Kunlun's history that always thought small eventually truly shrank, and eventually disappeared.  
But before that time they had a ^ff0000Mini-town^000000 that they lived in on ground beneath Kunlun.  
That place is an object lesson against stagnant thinking.
