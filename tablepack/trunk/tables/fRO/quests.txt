Would you go and deliver this letter to Kaci for me? It's from some guy named Mr. Mawong, her mentor or something like that.#
Deliver the letter to Kaci.#

8037#Delivering letter to Kaci#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Oh, Hallen must have asked you to deliver this. He should be doing this sort of thing himself, instead of asking customers for favors! If you ever need a little favor from me, feel free to ask me, alright?#
 #

8039#Secret of Airships#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
These Airships are so huge and heavy, and I can scarcely believe that they can fly. How is it even possible? you could find out for me, Well, if it'd be a really big help.#
 #

8040#Secret of Airships#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Really...? Are you serious? An imitation of Ymir's Heart Piece. Now where have I heard about that before? Mm, let me think... #
 #

8041#Secret of Airships#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Kaci told me about a drunkard that always mentions Ymir's Heart when he plays the Dice game for Apples!#
 #

8042#Secret of Airships#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
I met that guy when I was helping Shinokas. He was one of the directors of the Einbroch Laboratory that had a piece of Ymir's Heart. It's worth investigating...#
 #

8043#Secret of Airships#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
You were asking me about the Airship's flight mechanics. So you're not an employee... You better get out of here. The guards patrol this place regularly, so you're almost sure to get caught. Hmm, come and see me later at the Airship, alright? Now hurry!#
You must go and see Ferlock.#

8044#Euslan's Fiancee#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
...Are you really willing to go out and look for Thierry for me? Oh, thank you so much! You don't know how much your kind offer means to me. Thierry went on a trip, traveling on one of the Airships, to find some medicine that the doctors say I need for my illness.#
 #

8045#Tips from Kaci#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Ah, I know! I'll ask the Airship Captain to help you: he's got the list of passengers and their destinations.#
Check out the passengers list from the captain.#

8046#Ferlock's Passengers list#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
According to this, he last took an Airship to Hugel. That's all that this says.#
 #

8047#Euslan's Favor#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
If you get the chance, please visit my brother Eukran in Hugel, and ask him where my Thierry might be.#
 #

8048#Eukran's Testimony#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
You see, Thierry passed by here about a month ago, and told me that he had to visit the Odin Shrine. I wasn't sure then, but now I think he's trying to help my sister.#
 #

8049#Thierry's Favor#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
I can't really go into the details, but I'm doing this work to find a cure for Euslan's disease. It's not curable by modern medicine...#
 #

8050#Danger coming on to Thierry#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Thierry seems to have caught on to what we're really up to. I think that's why he's slowing down on his research. We better get rid of him before it's too late.#
 #

8051#Euslan's Medicine#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
It doesn't matter what happens to me, but I must save Euslan. I only need 5 Runes of the Darkness to finish that medicine. Please help me get them, adventurer...#

8052#Thierry's Favor#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Please understand that I want to see her as soon as I can, but I have to wait until those Rekenber agents stop searching for me. Please give that medicine to Euslan as soon as you can: her life depends on it.#

This tree means so much to everyone in this town, and we all have special memories of this place. But that El Schatt fellow plans to chop it down for his shop...#
 #

8058#Conversation with El Schatt#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Look, memories are nice and all, but I don't dwell on the past. Hey, I've got some great memories of this place too, but you know what? I've decided to let go of them before they get too painful. That's life. My father's been wanting to build a shop here for so long, and now, I think it's about time.#
 #

8059#Conversation with Perfitz#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
I'm pleased that my son has finally set his mind on the family business. It's funny... He used to deperately fight me when it came to building shops where that tree has planted. I get this gut feeling that something's not right, like he's too excited about cutting that tree down. Maybe this old man is just too suspcious~#
 #

8060#Stubborn El Schatt#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
It's true that I used to think differently... I'd protect that old tree with my life, I won't deny it. But that's an old story that should be buried in the past..#
 #

8061#Grumbling Manainne#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Now El Schatt is just a heartless, money grubbing...! He's completely changed. My sister would be rolling in her grave, seeing him now...#
 #

I... I can borrow my sister's body? Yes, if she cooperates, maybe... Maybe it will work. I must... must do something before he... he... he hurts himself even more...#
