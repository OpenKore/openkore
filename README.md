## Weekly Maintenance on Official Servers
All official servers _(especially bRO & iRO)_ have weekly maintenance & after maintenance is over, usually openkore will stop working on these servers.
If you are seeing a green message written: `timeout on map server... reconnecting....`
that means you have to wait for developer to update openkore.
So please wait. You don't need to make an issue to tell this.
Check the [status of botting on official servers](https://github.com/OpenKore/openkore#status-of-botting-on-official-servers) regarding your servers; how often it being updated & who's supporting it.
