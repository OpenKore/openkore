### Weekly Maintence on official Servers
Some official servers (like bRO and iRO) have a weekly maintence.  
When this weekly maintence happens, openkore stops working on this server.  
To make it work again, a developer have to update openkore.  
So if you see a green message written: **timeout on map server... reconnecting....** that means you have to wait for developer to update openkore.  
So please wait, don't need to make an issue to tell this.
