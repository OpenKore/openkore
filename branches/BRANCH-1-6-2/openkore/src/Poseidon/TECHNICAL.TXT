Poseidon is a solution for the GameGuard problem. Server like bRO use
GameGuard. The RO server sends a packet to the client, and the client
must response with an appropriate packet.


Overview
--------
Poseidon works like this:
1. Poseidon sets up a fake RO server (let us call it PoseidonRO).
2. Poseidon sets up another server socket for communication with OpenKore.
3. OpenKore connects to Poseidon.
4. RO client connects to PoseidonRO.

5. Real RO server sends GameGuard query to OpenKore.
6. OpenKore sends GameGuard query to Poseidon.
7. Poseidon sends GameGuard query to RO client.
8. RO client sends a reply.
9. Poiseidon sends reply to OpenKore.
10. OpenKore sends reply to real RO server.


Protocol
--------
The Poseidon server uses the same message format as the IPC subsystem.
See the IPC::Messages module for information.

A request to the Poseidon server is as follows:
Message ID: "Poseidon Query"
Key 'packet' - The GameGuard packet, as sent by the RO server.

The Poseidon server replies with the following message:
Message ID: "Poseidon Reply"
Key 'packet' - Response to send back to the GameGuard server.


Fascade
-------
The Poseidon::Client module provides a simple interface for OpenKore to
use Poseidon.
