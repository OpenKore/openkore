Kidd's request was simpler than you thought. At Southwest Morroc, you must meet Rin at the underground tavern.#

You've got the 4th key. It seems that a passage to the devildom has been enforced to connect to somewhere else. Maybe this is something that has to do with thoes angles appearing in the tower.#

At the Raffine's post called, 'Splendide,' you met a Raffine, 'Arch' who asked you to find the friend, 'Terra.'  He says Terra usually leaves traces by plaiting straws.#
Find the traces of Terra.#

7057#Messenger - Arch's Favor#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
You've found a trace near Splendide. Looks like the traces are taking the direction of South. Let's keep looking.#
Find the traces of Terra.#

7058#Messenger - Arch's Favor#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
You fell on the place between giant roots of a tree. You've found a giant tribe called 'Sapa,' hard as rocks and big as mountain. Seems like there's no more traces left for Terra.#
Report to Arch#

7059#Messenger - Terra's Whereabouts#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Arch's worrying about Terra went off with Bradium from the Lab without permission. Terra could have gone to 'Sapa' in that 'Cave' with Bradium.#
Go find Terra..#

7060#Messenger - Terra's Whereabouts#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
When you arrived to see Sapa, Terra has already long gone. Very bright pieces of mineral were scattered around the hardened giant. These pieces must be the Bradium.#
If Bradium is related.. would it be Sapa?#

7061#Messenger - Terra's Whereabouts#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
In the town of 'Sapa,' you overheard something at 'Manuk,' that a 'Raffine' is captured.#
You must find the captured Raffine.#

7062#Messenger - Terra's Whereabouts#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
You heard that this Raffine captured in Manuk is injured.  Maybe you'll be able to see her if you get some remedy.#
Ask Arch#

7063#Messenger - Terra's Whereabouts#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
You found out that 'Yggdrasil berry' is the best remedy for the Raffine. You should collect some Yggdrasil berries around the gigantic tree.#
Collect at least 6 Yggdrasil berries#

7064#Messenger - Terra's Whereabouts#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
You've collected the last Yggdrasil berry. You must deliver these to Snorren at Manuk.#
Deliver the Yggdrasil berries to Snorren#

7065#Messenger - Terra's Whereabouts#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
You could talk to the captured Raffine through Snorren's help. You must interpret the conversation with the Raffine to Snorren and Luik.#
Conversation with Raffine#

7066#Messenger - Prove the Truth#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Luik doubts Terra's story about discovering the gigantic cave inside the roots of gigantic tree and the dying Sapa. Snorren suspects that the hardened Sapa might be his friend, 'Ogen' and requests to see the evidence.#
Go back to the cave and find some evidences#

7067#Messenger - Prove the Truth#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
You've got some 'Bradium's  fragments' from the hardened body of Sapa and a 'Shabby Muffler.' These will just do!#
Show the evidences to Luik and Snorren#

7068#Messenger - Prove the Truth#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Looks like the 'Shabby Muffler' is the one from a friend of Snorren's. It was also proved that Terra was really trying to save 'Ogen' with 'Bradium's fragments'. You and Snorren decided to go save Ogen.#
Go to Ogen before it's too late#

7069#Messenger - Too late!#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Looks like you're too late for saving Ogen. Snorren turned his back and started to walk back to the town. You should pick up Terra.#
#

7070#Messenger - Terra's Return#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
You heard from Snorren that Terra has been released.#
#

7071#Messenger - Invitation#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Arch invited you to Terra's residence to talk about the details. Terra's home is one of hundreds of Yai hanging on the leaves, located at the South-East area of the post.#

Cat ears? Not cat merchants? I have no idea. By the way have you met Ahat already? He is really beautiful and noble.#
#

7189#Information Gathering - in the Factory#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
A man with Cat ears? I've never heard of it. Do not try to find that kind of unreliable thing and just go to meet Ahat. He is real nice! He is the role model of Sapha!#
#

7190#Information Gathering - at the Guards#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Cat ears? You sure? Are your human kind always like that? Why don't you just go to meet Ahat. He is a very strong Sapha.He may be a Jarute working through piles of documents but he must be hiding his power!!#
#

#

7196#What's this suspicious magic power?#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
You found a suspicious magical stone fragment. It feels like the magic power from the crack. Does this have anything to do with Ahat?#
#

7197#Exploit Certifications? Exploit Certifications!#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Finally I decided to go to meet Ahat to solve doubts. However it's necessary to have a exploit certification of Sapha in order to have an audience with Ahat. Carry out some quests you can find throughout the capital and collect them.#
Collect 3 Exploit Certifications of Sapha#

7198#Audience with Ahat#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#

7442#The identity of the scholar of magics#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
The scholar of magics found through the strategy was indeed Avant. Must tell this to Kardui.# 
Talk with Kardui.#

7443#Interfere with the research!#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE# 
A small revenge. Kardui and Hisie want to know what Avant is researching and want to interfere it. Could this be a small revenge of the brothers?# 
Interfereing Avant's research.#

7444#What Avant was researching#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Avant was researching on the methods to extract the Orb's magic power. Since this is dangerous information, the research materials should immediately be returned to Kardui.#

7445#Avant's back#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Researched the force behind Avant's research on the Orb. The most likely culpril is Avant's sponsor, the chief of staff. Approach the chief of staff to reveal the truth.# 
Talk with the chief of staff.#

7446#Unfruitful conversation#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Talked with Shenime the chief of staff, but nothing was gained. He states that he might also have been tricked by Avant. The chief of staff was actually upset that Kardui only increased the defenses surrounding the Orb.# 
Report to Kardui.#

7447#Dilemma surrounding the Orb#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Only confirmed the distrust toward Kardui's instead of revealing more about Avant's research. The chief of staff hoped that Kardui's judgment has not weakened, and asked that he would demonstrate it.# 
Report to Kardui.#

7448#Something's not right#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
After discussing with Kardui and Hisie, it is decided that the chief of staff is indeed the most suspicious. What is the reason behind his resistance toward Kardui's actions toward the Orb?#

Report to Kardui.#

7450#Orb's lighting room#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Not sure why the chief of staff kept trying to lure me into the Orb's lighting room, but decided to go there even just to figure out why. Let's go along with what he wants for now.# 
Hold hands with the chief of staff.#

7451#Betrayal#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Everything is so confusing. The monster battled in the lighting room was not a subordinate of the King of Demons. They controlled me without my knowledge. Shenime the chief of staff betrayed all!# 
Report to Kardui.#

7452#Find the chief of staff!#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Shenime the chief of staff, who was responsible for all these occurrences, has hidden his whereabouts. According to Hisie's sources, residual magic force was faintly felt in Bifrost.#

Wuhari received the report, but stated that it will take some time to analyze the report. Try talking to him a bit later. Don't bother someone when he is studying.# 
Time for analysis.#

14133#Another favor#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Wuhari analyzed the research report, but he was still unsure about how to recover his brother's body. Try finding and asking the Laphine who originally requested Wuhuru's participation in research.# 
Obtaining the evidence.#
 
14134#Sharp Ms. Goatie#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Although Mr. Svery was visited for more insight, he said that he has no idea about the high-level Laphine. However, he suggested seeing his wife who's sharp with these things.# 
To Ms. Goatie.#

14135#Searching for Mr. Pompe#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
When asked about the high-level Laphine's whereabouts, Ms. Goatie did not know much. However, a neighbor in town, Mr. Pompe, shared that he saw a Laphine in the field who later disappeared. Let's ask Mr. Pompe in more detail.# 
Hearing the story from Mr. Pompe.#

14136#A terrible scene in the field#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Mr. Pompe is afraid of going out to the field. He talked about how a big corpse has been lying there ever since one high-level Laphine suffered a terrible death. Investigate the field.# 
Field investigation.#

14137#An interesting proposition#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
One Laphine girl made an interesting proposition. It seemed that the Laphine who gave Wuhuru the research report is the same person as her lost father. Let's look for him together.# 
Field investigation.#

14138#The big corpse#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
There was a big corpse that seemed to have been there a while. He was the Laphine that everyone has been looking for. We have to let the girl know this bad news.# 
Report to Giranni.#

14139#To Wuhuru#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
The girl confirmed that the corpse was her father's. I have to go back to Wuhari empty-handed since the Laphine of interest has died. Before that, let's go to Wuhuru to tell him about the Laphine he had worked with.# 
To Wuhuru.#

14140#To Wuhari#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Wuhuru shared all of his story, but that cannot be shared in its entirely to Wuhari. Go to Wuhari to at least tell him that the Laphine has died.# 
Report to Wuhari.#

14141#Ingredients for research#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Wuhari asked for ingredients that he could use to research on his own. Provide Wuhari with his necessary ingredients. (1 Wing piece, 1 sturdy hair, 1 Bradium, 1 rune of darkness, 1 rune of blood).#
