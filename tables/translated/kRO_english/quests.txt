If you go east of the village, there is a residential alley that runs all the way to the north. Isn't that the dead end that Melissa talked about? Search around that alley.#

Speak with Shnayim#

7437#Shnayim's Request#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Let alone information about Avant but I instead got a strange request from <NAVI>[Shnayim]<INFO>ecl_in03,245,93,0,101,0</INFO></NAVI>. Asked to gather experimental ingredients for the scholar of magics he sponsors. They are 10 Dust Balls, 10 Leaf Bookmarks.#

7438#Secret Sponsorship#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
<NAVI>[Shnayim]<INFO>ecl_in03,245,93,0,101,0</INFO></NAVI> did not share even a bit about the scholar of magics he sponsors, and asks to forget about even finding out about it. Let's ask the Guard <NAVI>[Minuel]<INFO>ecl_in01,82,70,0,101,0</INFO></NAVI> and <NAVI>[Hisie]<INFO>ecl_tdun04,32,35,0,101,0</INFO></NAVI>.#

7439#The scholar of magics sponsored by Shnayim#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Hisie stated that if you track down Shnayim, the location of the scholar might be identified as well. Find out Shnayim's duties. Should I ask the guard, <NAVI>[Minuel]<INFO>ecl_in01,82,70,0,101,0</INFO></NAVI>?#
Talk to Minuel#

7440#Minuel's witness#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Eclage guard Minuel stated that Shnayim often travels east, in the opposite direction from his Yai. Discuss with <NAVI>[Hisie]<INFO>ecl_tdun04,32,35,0,101,0</INFO></NAVI>.#
Talk to Hisie#

7441#Delivery has arrived!#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
I decided to visit the magician's <NAVI>[Yai]<INFO>eclage,304,234,0,101,0</INFO></NAVI> to get 10 Dustballs and 10 Leaf Bookmarks, which are research materials. Hisie will confirm whether that person is Avant. Hisie will provide the information at the crossroads in front of Eclage.#
10 Dustballs, 10 Leaf Bookmarks#

7442#Magician's Identity#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
The scholar of magics found through the strategy was indeed Avant. I must tell this to <NAVI>[Kardui]<INFO>ecl_in03,41,90,0,101,0</INFO></NAVI>.#
Talk to Kardui#

7443#Interfere with the research!#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Kardui and Hisie want to know what Avant is researching and want to interfere with it. Could this be a small revenge of the brothers? Let's find Avant's <NAVI>[Yai]<INFO>eclage,304,234,0,101,0</INFO></NAVI> and sabotage the research!#
Interfering with Avant's research#

7444#What Avant was researching#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Avant was researching on the methods to extract the Orb's magic power. Since this is dangerous information, the research materials should immediately be returned to <NAVI>[Kardui]<INFO>ecl_in03,41,90,0,101,0</INFO></NAVI>.#
Deliver the research materials to Kardui#

7445#Avant's Back#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
I decided to investigate who was behind the Avant who studied the Orb. Currently, the prime suspect is the Chief of Staff who sponsored Avant. We need to approach the <NAVI>[Chief of Staff]<INFO>ecl_in03,245,93,0,101,0</INFO></NAVI> to reveal the truth.#
Talk to the Chief of Staff#

7446#Unfruitful Conversation#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
I tried talking to the <NAVI>[Chief of Staff]<INFO>ecl_in03,245,93,0,101,0</INFO></NAVI>, but there was no particular result. He says he seems to have been tricked by Avant's flattery. On the contrary, the Chief of Logistics is showing strong dissatisfaction with <NAVI>[Kardui]<INFO>ecl_in03,41,90,0,101,0</INFO></NAVI> strengthening the protection of the Orb.#
Report to Kardui#

7447#Conflict over the Orb#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
I only confirmed my distrust of <NAVI>[Kardui]<INFO>ecl_in03,41,90,0,101,0</INFO></NAVI> rather than Avant's research. The Chief of Staff hoped that Kardui's judgment is not clouded, and asked that he would demonstrate it.#
Report to Kardui#

7448#Something's not right#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
After discussing with Kardui and Hisie, it is decided that the <NAVI>[Chief of Staff]<INFO>ecl_in03,245,93,0,101,0</INFO></NAVI> is indeed the most suspicious. What is the reason behind his resistance toward Kardui's actions toward the Orb?#
Surveillance of the Chief of Staff#

7449#Temptation toward the Orb#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
The Chief of Staff recommends going there while talking about Orb's lighting room. First of all, I decided to ask <NAVI>[Kardui]<INFO>ecl_in03,41,90,0,101,0</INFO></NAVI> for time to think about it.#
Report to Kardui#

7450#Orb's Lighting Room#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
I don't know why the <NAVI>[Chief of Staff]<INFO>ecl_in03,245,93,0,101,0</INFO></NAVI> kept trying to lure me into the Orb's lighting room, but decided to go there even just to figure out why. Let's go along with what he wants for now.#
Follow the Chief of Staff#

7451#Betrayal#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Everything is so confusing. The monster battled in the lighting room was not a subordinate of the King of Demons. They controlled me without my knowledge. Shnayim the chief of staff betrayed all! I need to inform <NAVI>[Kardui]<INFO>ecl_in03,41,90,0,101,0</INFO></NAVI>.#
Report to Kardui#

7452#Find the Chief of Staff!#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Shnayim the Chief of Staff, who was responsible for all these occurrences, has hidden his whereabouts. According to Hisie's sources, residual magic force was faintly felt in Bifrost.#

8196#The Tripartite Union's Feud#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Those researchers complain a lot these days. They're terribly stressed out and I think somebody should really listen to their problems. Especially those dealing with document files argue with each other many times. You might wanna start by talking to them.#
#

8197#Document Delivery#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Ok, now, please deliver the file to Hue and Hansenne. Hue's in charge of Schwaltzvalt documents and Hansenne's in charge of Arunafeltz'. You should go see Hue at Schwaltzvalt's office, otherwise, he'd be whining about it.#

I lost it. I think I might have dropped it into the river or something when I played treasure-hunting on a bridge! But then,those pussy cats on the South-West can teach us fishing, you know. Maybe we can catch that document fishing on the river!#
Go back to Hansenne with the document you caught#

8202#Document Restoration#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Schwaltzvalt people have some talent in restoring things like this... Why don't you ask Hue to restore this? He'd scream so hard and the windows might break.#
#

8203#Document Restoration#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
It's completely soaked.. I should dry this thing first and iron these crumples. Then, I should restore the texts. I need some materials. You gotta help me on this. I need ^0000ff1 Folding Fan of Cat Ghost, 1 Old Frying Pan, 1 Flame Stone, 1 Squid Ink^000000.#

Listen to Shurank's Lecture#

8221#Shurank's Lecture#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Activating Endure enables you to shrug off attacks. You'll receive damage, but enemy attacks will not impede you as much. This means you can counter enemy attacks or escape if you need to. Alright. Now I want you to train in the use of the Endure skill. You can become a great Swordman.#

11061#Coward Boy Mikhail#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Why do you say that you broke something precious or that your face is blue, so you need a strong glue? There are a lot of men in the tavern, so I asked you to go there.#
Michael seems to have gone to the tavern. Let's go to the tavern and find Mikhail.#

There is no trace of someone coming. Let's go back to Mikhail's house.#

11066#Coward Boy Mikhail#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Looking back inside the house, Mikhail was hiding in the brazier. Let's get the glue and help attach Matryoshka.#
Let's go to Viktor at the pub to ask for the exact ingredients of the adhesive.#

11067#Coward Boy Mikhail#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
There is a big island near Moscovia. From there, you can see a swamp when you go deep into the forest. ^0000FFwhich grows in that swamp, 10 ^000000 kwa. And a ^0000FFmedicine bowl^000000. Don't forget to bring it.#

I should let Rebarev Doug know I'm ABOUT TO LEAVE, oh but first I should make sure I find out more about the FINAL MISSION.#

Ask Librarian Jekan if he has found the 1st squad's final mission's paper work. He has bad eyesight and is in need of a Magnifier and a Lantern.#
#

60724#Seal of Megingjard#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Librarian Jekan looks to be busy, perhaps I should just "read some documents" for awhile and then check on the shelves for until he figures out where I should check on the shelves for "The 3rd Platoon Records".#
#

60725#Seal of Megingjard#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Jekan will need a few items to make a copy of the records. 2 Slick Paper and 1 Oil Paper from Amatsu, 3 Feather of Birds from Morroc, and 20 Blue Gems from Geffen.#
Bring these items to Jekan to make him finish the copy faster#

60726#Seal of Megingjard#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Your copy of the records has a weird search magic on it. To find specific info, you need to first check for broad topic then get more specific: crusader 3rd_company 3rd_platoon 1st_squad.#
Look up the individual members names to find out where they are nowadays#

60727#Seal of Megingjard#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Find Zan Huadoku inside the Geffen Blacksmith guild. Observe politeness when asking him how he is doing before jumping in to ask about their top secret final mission. Yeah, that's the ticket!#
#

60728#Seal of Megingjard#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Zan Huadoku has told you all that you think is possible. You should head to Morroc to find "Cuaque Donon" who was last seen at the Inn. You have a feeling that you may need to be stubborn in Morroc.#
#

60729#Seal of Megingjard#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Cuaque Donon is in a Rogue Guild hideout probably at "Fortress Saint Darmain (South)" (use map ctrl + ~) The password to enter should be "Aragham never hoarded upgrade items".#
Cuaque is suffering from extreme PTSD and "freaks out" so pretending he is a young child would help, maybe even a dolly hahaha#

60730#Seal of Megingjard#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Cuaque said the squad found the "Megingjard" and an argument broke out... You need to know more about that argument, perhaps Jack.O in Alberta on the docks can help.#
He is still an active crusader, so I think talking to him will be much more straight forward#

60731#Seal of Megingjard#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Jack.O found some relief from "Green Herb". Perhaps I should pass that advice onto the other Crusaders I meet. Emma Searth is in Aldebaran, a quick boat to Izlude and a Kafra warp to Aldebaran will have me there in a jiffy!#
Maybe I should also contemplate a memory aid for these crusaders, something to help them remember their place like a "Bookclip" from a "Rideword"#

60732#Seal of Megingjard#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
I think I need to hurry to see "The Nineball" he works as a bouncer in the Jawaii inn. I heard there is an ex-barkeep of Jawaii working in the Central Prontera Pub maybe he knows a way to get to Jawaii without tying the knot!#
Someone named Nineball and who is a bouncer probably is pretty closed mouth kinda guy, I should keep talking until he at least reacts to my questions..#

60733#Seal of Megingjard#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Exit Jawaii with a Butterflywing or drink yourself back to Rune-Midgarts. Get to Comodo to see "Royal Myst" at the south casino. Morroc to Comodo is usually the easiest way to warp to Comodo.#
A "couple" of shots of "Alcohol" can loosen Royal Myst's tongue..#

60734#Seal of Megingjard#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
You've spoken to all the crusaders that are still alive, apparently something happened, blame was passed and Crusader Egnigem died in the process. You should return to Prontera Castle and inform him of your findings.#
A kafra hop from Comodo to Morroc to Prontera is quick unless you're saved in Prontera#

60735#Seal of Megingjard#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
You should talk to the last member of the 1st squad, the late Egnigem. A Kafra hop from Prontera to Morroc to Comodo then to Umbala and then a journey north to the Tree of Life to Niflheim can get you to him.#
Listen to Egnigem and see what you can do to fix this#

60736#Seal of Megingjard#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
By Odin's mercy this is terrible, you never believed that a holy Crusader would do such an evil act to claim the power of Megingjard. Be brave and return to the Crusader Headquarters and tell Max Von Shedough what you know.#
#

60737#Seal of Megingjard#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Max Von Shedough has accepted my report, and is deeply troubled by its contents, but part of me truly believes that despite good intentions the political reality may intervene to keep justice from being had.#
I must tell Egnigem at least of the outcome, he deserves at least to know what he died for.#

60738#Seal of Megingjard#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Egnigem has blessed you with all his remaining strength. You have a feeling that there is one special someone that he would want to know his fate, You must tell Emma Searth about his fate.#
#

60739#Seal of Megingjard#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Emma can't Remember, but she can feel the loss. Your faith in Justice is weak now... You must tell Max Von Shedough he is the Judge and he should share this burden of guilt.#
