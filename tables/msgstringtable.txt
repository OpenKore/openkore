A giant crevice appeared in Bifrost, the bridge between Splendide, the end of the world and the floating continent of Alfheim, and you do not know the source of the labyrinth forest.#
This is a marker indicating the end of the trip, a new world is opening indicators! Guardian, such as the lyrics to the temptation was gradually losing the soul.#
For thousands of years, a mysterious melody has mesmerized the guardian. After a millennia of slumber, the guardian became confused about what he had been protecting all these years, and began to suspect that he might be the one who has been sealed and hidden away.#
When the melody reached its peak, a giant crevice appeared in Bifrost, the bridge between Splendide, the end of the world and the floating continent of Alfheim. As a result, the two worlds were cut off from each other, causing a big problem for the people.#
Now, the only way to get to Bifrost is through the Labyrinth Forest. Nobody knows how the forest came to exist, and nobody has ever come out of it alive...#
Swallowed countless adventurers to put a hell of confusion, wandering in the forest labyrinth of nowhere, like the heart of a woman was being extend deeper confusion.#
