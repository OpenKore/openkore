There is a ^ff0000small hill in Kunlun^000000 that is said to of been the Great Philosophers favorite meditation spot,
you should visit there and see if any grand thoughts take you.
No matter how great a culture is, there will always be a few among its citizenry that just don't 'get it'.
Those in Kunlun's history that always thought small eventually truly shrank, and eventually disappeared.
But before that time they had a ^ff0000Mini-town^000000 that they lived in on ground beneath Kunlun.
That place is an object lesson against stagnant thinking.
